# [FFXIV Macro Time Counter](http://ffxivmacro.pythonanywhere.com/)
A very simple Flask app that counts how long your macro is based on the number of wait commands and tags in your macro. Paste in all the commands that will run in your chain of macros and get the total time it would take to complete.
